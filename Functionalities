Development tasks:

Login form validation
	- user id, password required
	- frontend submits resetpassword, if failure, show error in login page
	
Signup sends activation email to email id and creates user record status as 'new' (possible statuses - 'new', 'active', 'suspended', 'deleted')
	- Once user clicks the activation url, it hits frontend with a token that gets validated against server copy sent out to backend which marks user record as 'active'
	- frontend after getting a 200 OK response, redirects to login page
	- User logs in from there

Forgot password, new form to provide user id, click continue, sends a email with reset password link
	- user goes to that link which shows a form with user id, new password, retype password inputs
	- user fills out and hit submit, password updates, user status is marked as 'active' and frontend redirects to login page.

5 incorrect login attempts mark user record to 'suspended'
	- if backend returns user is inactive, then show message that 'This user account is suspended due to numerous login attempts. Please reset your password using Forget Password to proceed.'
